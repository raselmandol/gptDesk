I am delighted to present GPT Desk, a desktop application(made with C#(.NET)) that I made to give desktop users to use ChatGPT on Windows(Working on MAC v1 and Linux(v1) with some extra number of tools. I made this application in my free time (can call in my ToTo Lab). Created with unwavering dedication during precious moments of free time, UB GUI is a tribute to the unconditional love and unwavering support of two incredible individuals: My Parents. When I will get free time again, i will make a better version of this one. Hope you all will enjoy this one.
